<div id="legend" style="opacity:0;">
The top-left panel is a heat map of a measure association (LOD score) between genotype
at a fixed position and the phenotype at a fixed time. 
Red indicates 
that BB lines have larger phenotype values, and blue indicates that AA lines
have larger phenotype values.  We consider only those (position, time)
pairs with LOD > 1.</p>

<p>When you hover over a point in the top-left plot, the LOD curves for the
corresponding time are shown below, and the phenotype averages and
estimated QTL effect (across time) for the corresponding genomic
position are shown to the right.</p>

<p>Click on a point to show pointwise confidence bands on the QTL
effect (&plusmn; 2 SE).  (We require a mouse click, as otherwise the graph
was painfully slow to refresh.)</p>
