### Poster: &ldquo;Data visualizations should be more interactive&rdquo;

See it in action
[here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/posters/ENAR2014).

This is material for a poster I will give at
[ENAR 2014](http://www.enar.org/meetings2014) in Baltimore, MD, on 16
March 2014.

The interactive graphs use [D3.js](http://d3js.org),
[d3.tip](http://github.com/Caged/d3-tip), and
[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org), but those libraries are not
included here.

I'm also leaving off the data files. You can find them
[on the web](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/posters/ENAR2014) if
you know what you're doing. If you need help,
[just ask](http://twitter.com/kwbroman).
