1. Gough mouse example:

 1a. Phenotypes over time:
     - heat map of the curves
     - all the curves
     - scatterplots of week 1 vs 5 vs 15
       OR: week 1 vs change (wk 5 - wk 1) vs change (wk 15 - wk 5)

     brush scatterplots to highlight curves
     or highlight curves via heatmap?

  1b. Genome scans for each time point
      - image of LOD curves
      - linked to genome scan for that time point
      - linked to detail on a given chromosome?
      - also, to plot of average curves for each genotype
        (as well as additive and dominance effects?)


2. Attie eQTL project:

   2a. many box plots
   2b. heat map of expression linked to scatterplot
   2c. LOD curve for insulin linked to QTL effect
   2d. eQTL plot


--- 

Attie figures are ready

Gough figures need:
  - panel for plotting multiple curves
  - heat map of LOD curves

  - multiple curves linked to 2 scatterplots
  - heat map of LOD curves linked to individual LOD curve and
    estimated effects
